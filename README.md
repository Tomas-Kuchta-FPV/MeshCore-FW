## MeshCore Repeater Observer

This fork adds a CoreScope packet observer to the MeshCore repeater firmware for the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 with Wio-SX1262. The repeater remains the primary function; packet observation and forwarding over Wi-Fi/MQTT run as an additional service.

### Installing the firmware

- Use the `OTA.bin` file to update an existing installation through MeshCore OTA. This normally preserves the existing repeater configuration.
- Use the `merged.bin` file for a complete first installation over USB. A full flash can erase the existing device configuration.
- After installation, connect to the repeater with the MeshCore mobile app by Liam Cottle and open **Remote Management**.

### Configuring the CoreScope observer

Observer settings are stored in the repeater and can be changed from the MeshCore mobile app without recompiling the firmware. Connect to the repeater, open **Remote Management**, and send the commands below. Administrator authentication is required if an admin password is configured.

Show a summary of the current configuration:

```text
get corescope
```

Show the available setting names:

```text
corescope
```

Read an individual setting, for example:

```text
get corescope.wifi.ssid
get corescope.mqtt3.host
get corescope.iata
get corescope.observer.name
```

Set up the default Czech CoreScope configuration:

```text
set corescope.wifi.ssid Guest
set corescope.wifi.password -
set corescope.mqtt3.host mqtt1.meshcore.cz
set corescope.mqtt3.port 443
set corescope.mqtt3.audience mqtt1.meshcore.cz
set corescope.mqtt4.host mqtt2.meshcore.website
set corescope.mqtt4.port 443
set corescope.mqtt4.audience mqtt2.meshcore.website
set corescope.ws.path /
set corescope.iata JCL
set corescope.observer.name XIAO CoreScope
```

Replace `Guest`, `JCL`, and `XIAO CoreScope` with your own Wi-Fi network, three-character observer location code, and observer name. To configure a protected Wi-Fi network, replace `-` with its password:

```text
set corescope.wifi.password your-password
```

The password is never returned in plain text. `get corescope.wifi.password` reports only `(set)` or `(empty)`. The IATA/location code must contain exactly three letters or digits and is stored in uppercase. The WebSocket path must start with `/`.

Each successful change returns:

```text
OK - saved; reboot to apply
```

After entering all settings, restart the repeater. The saved observer configuration is then used for the Wi-Fi and MQTT connections. The standard MeshCore commands such as `set name`, position, radio settings, and administrator password continue to configure the repeater independently; `set name` does not change `corescope.observer.name`.

## About MeshCore

MeshCore is a lightweight, portable C++ library that enables multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects using LoRa and other packet radios. It is designed for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet.

## 🔍 What is MeshCore?

MeshCore now supports a range of LoRa devices, allowing for easy flashing without the need to compile firmware manually. Users can flash a pre-built binary using tools like Adafruit ESPTool and interact with the network through a serial console.
MeshCore provides the ability to create wireless mesh networks, similar to Meshtastic and Reticulum but with a focus on lightweight multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects. Unlike Meshtastic, which is tailored for casual LoRa communication, or Reticulum, which offers advanced networking, MeshCore balances simplicity with scalability, making it ideal for custom embedded solutions, where devices (nodes) can communicate over long distances by relaying messages through intermediate nodes. This is especially useful in off-grid, emergency, or tactical situations where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable.

## ⚡ Key Features

* Multi-Hop Packet Routing
  * Devices can forward messages across multiple nodes, extending range beyond a single radio's reach.
  * Supports up to a configurable number of hops to balance network efficiency and prevent excessive traffic.
  * Nodes use fixed roles where "Companion" nodes are not repeating messages at all to prevent adverse routing paths from being used.
* Supports LoRa Radios – Works with Heltec, RAK Wireless, and other LoRa-based hardware.
* Decentralized & Resilient – No central server or internet required; the network is self-healing.
* Low Power Consumption – Ideal for battery-powered or solar-powered devices.
* Simple to Deploy – Pre-built example applications make it easy to get started.

## 🎯 What Can You Use MeshCore For?

* Off-Grid Communication: Stay connected even in remote areas.
* Emergency Response & Disaster Recovery: Set up instant networks where infrastructure is down.
* Outdoor Activities: Hiking, camping, and adventure racing communication.
* Tactical & Security Applications: Military, law enforcement, and private security use cases.
* IoT & Sensor Networks: Collect data from remote sensors and relay it back to a central location.

## Contributing

Please submit PR's using 'dev' as the base branch!
For minor changes just submit your PR and we'll try to review it, but for anything more 'impactful' please open an Issue first and start a discussion. It is better to sound out what it is you want to achieve first, and try to come to a consensus on what the best approach is, especially when it impacts the structure or architecture of this codebase.

Here are some general principles you should try to adhere to:
* Keep it simple. Please, don't think like a high-level lang programmer. Think embedded, and keep code concise, without any unnecessary layers.
* No dynamic memory allocation, except during setup/begin functions.
* Use the same brace and indenting style that's in the core source modules. (A .clang-format is probably going to be added soon, but please do NOT retroactively re-format existing code. This just creates unnecessary diffs that make finding problems harder)

Help us prioritize! Please react with thumbs-up to issues/PRs you care about most. We look at reaction counts when planning work.

### Running unit tests

To run unit tests, run the following command:

```bash
pio test --environment native --verbose
